-- Consolidates three changes into one function body (signature byte-
-- identical to the previous version — new data rides inside the existing
-- p_leader/p_members jsonb params, no new SQL parameters):
--
-- 1. Roles for every member, including the leader (previously only
--    additional members ever got role_in_team set).
-- 2. College consolidation: the server now sends one already-resolved
--    college value for the leader AND every member (see resolveCollege()
--    in app/actions/registration.ts), so the per-member same-college
--    cross-check and its v_leader_college_norm helper are dead code —
--    removed entirely rather than left in place.
-- 3. Team size 2-5 (previously 1-5) — a leader-only "team" is no longer a
--    valid submission.
--
-- Also requires id_card_path on the leader and every member (the new
-- member-id-cards bucket + column from the sibling migration
-- 20260915010000_member_id_cards.sql).
